                <p class="information__paragraph "> As you can see on the Internet, many people deny the existence of <span class="bold">this man</span>, likening his story to a fabricated “urban legend”.</p>
                <p class="information__paragraph ">Despite the evidence and testimonials that seem to validate the authenticity of this story, skepticism remains. Some critics claim that the coincidences and stories associated with <span class="bold">this man</span> are too implausible to be true, and consider them fabrications or exaggerations of real events.</p>

              <section class="information-textstart">
                <p class="information__paragraph ">Yet there are too many facts to support the existence of <span class="bold">this man</span>. Independent testimonials from all over the world describe similar, detailed experiences, and these people had no connection with each other before sharing their stories.</p>
                <p class="information__paragraph ">Could these isolated but similar testimonies reveal a hidden reality that some would prefer to keep in the shadows? Does not coincidence have its limits? You be the judge, but the facts seem to point to a disturbing truth, far removed from mere urban legend.</p>

                <h2 class="information__title">History of the urban legend</h2>
                <p class="history__paragraph ">“In January 2006 in New York, the patient of a well-known psychiatrist draws the face of a man that has been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. In more than one occasion that man has given her advice on her private life. The woman swears she has never met the man in her life. That portrait lies forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until one day another patient recognizes that face and says that the man has often visited him in his dreams. He also claims he has never seen that man in his waking life.</p>
                <p class="history__paragraph ">The psychiatrist decides to send the portrait to some of his colleagues that have patients with recurrent dreams. Within a few months, four patients recognize the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams. All the patients refer to him as <span class="bold">this man</span>. From January 2006 until today, at least 2000 people have claimed they have seen <span class="bold">this man</span> in their dreams, in many cities all over the world: Los Angeles, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm, Paris, New Dehli, Moskow etc.</p>
                <p class="history__paragraph ">At the moment there is no ascertained relation or common trait among the people that have dreamed of seeing <span class="bold">this man</span>. Moreover, no living man has ever been recognized as resembling the man of the portrait by the people who have seen <span class="bold">this man</span> in their dreams.”</p>
