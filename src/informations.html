    <ul class="information-textbox__list">

      <p class="information-textbox__p">The legend was invented in 2008 by Italian marketer Andrea Natella. It is a marketing ploy, though Andrea Natella has never revealed what it was to promote; some sources suggest it was intended to promote a film of the same name by Bryan Bertino. </p>
      <p class="information-textbox__p">Ghost House Pictures bought ThisMan.org in May 2010 and announced that it was writing and directing a film about This Man with Bertino as writer/director. No further announcements on the film have been made since.</p>

  <h2 class="information-history__title" >History of the urban legend</h2>
  <p class="information-history__paragraph "> “In January 2006 in New York, the patient of a well-known psychiatrist draws the face of a man that has been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. In more than one occasion that man has given her advice on her private life. The woman swears she has never met the man in her life. That portrait lies forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until one day another patient recognizes that face and says that the man has often visited him in his dreams. He also claims he has never seen that man in his waking life.</p>
  <p class="information-history__paragraph ">The psychiatrist decides to send the portrait to some of his colleagues that have patients with recurrent dreams. Within a few months, four patients recognize the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams. All the patients refer to him as this man. From January 2006 until today, at least 2000 people have claimed they have seen <span class="bold">this man</span> in their dreams, in many cities all over the world: Los Angeles, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm, Paris, New Dehli, Moskow etc.</p>
  <p class="information-history__paragraph ">At the moment there is no ascertained relation or common trait among the people that have dreamed of seeing this man. Moreover, no living man has ever been recognized as resembling the man of the portrait by the people who have seen this man in their dreams.”</p>

<section class="information-debunk">

    <h2 class="information-debunk__title">In the end, is this man real ?</h2>
    <p class="information-debunk__paragraph">No, <span class="bold">this man</span> is not real. Or at least, this story about a portrait drawn by a psychiatrist's patient is entirely false, invented by Andrea Natella for marketing purposes. Like many urban legends or "creepy-pastas", this hoax worked very well, with so many people believing the story that they went so far as to create theories to explain the phenomenon, making <span class="bold">his man </span>tfamous all over the world. </p>
    <p class="information-debunk__paragraph">So why are there so many accounts of <span class="bold">this man ? Why do so many people claim to have seen him in their dreams ? </span></p>
    <p class="information-debunk__paragraph">Here is a representative diagram of potential explanations for the appearance of <span class="bold">this man </span>in dreams.</p>



    <img src="" alt="yeux" class="information-debunk__image">

    <ul class="information-debunk__list">
      <li class="information-debunk__item"><span class="bold">1. Cultural Influence:</span> External factors such as media, stories, and cultural narratives contribute to the creation of beliefs and perceptions surrounding this man.</li>
      <li class="information-debunk__item"><span class="bold">2. Suggestibility:</span> Individuals are influenced by the cultural narrative of this man, making them more susceptible to interpreting their dreams in alignment with the legend.</li>
      <li class="information-debunk__item"><span class="bold">3. Dream Interpretation:</span> People interpret their dreams through the lens of the legend, attributing significance to any imagery that vaguely resembles this man.</li>
      <li class="information-debunk__item"><span class="bold">4. False Memories:</span> Exposure to the legend may lead to the creation of false memories, causing individuals to genuinely believe they have dreamed of "This Man" when they haven't.</li>
      <li class="information-debunk__item"><span class="bold">5. Psychological Factors:</span> Internal psychological states such as stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders can influence dream content and frequency, potentially leading to dreams of this man.</li>
      <li class="information-debunk__item"><span class="bold">6. Collective Unconscious:</span> The concept of a collective unconscious suggests that universal archetypes and symbols, such as this man, may be activated in the dreams of individuals due to shared human experiences and fears.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="information-debunk__explanation">
<p class="information-debunk__explanation__el">Although there is no definitive explanation for why people claim to have dreamt of <span class="bold">this man</span>, a combination of psychological, cultural and cognitive factors probably contribute to this phenomenon. Studying these factors can shed light on the complexity of human perception, memory and belief. </p>
<p class="information-debunk__explanation__el">It is this idea, among others, that makes the <span class="bold">this man</span> story so fascinating.<span class="bold"> How a gigantic number of unrelated people have been touched by this legend, have testified to it, have discussed their dreams, whether or not they were false.</span> </p>
