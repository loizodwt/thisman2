                <p class="information-history__paragraph "> As you can see on the Internet, many people deny the existence of this man, likening his story to a fabricated “urban legend”.</p>
                <p class="information-history__paragraph ">Despite the evidence and testimonials that seem to validate the authenticity of this story, skepticism remains. Some critics claim that the coincidences and stories associated with this man are too implausible to be true, and consider them fabrications or exaggerations of real events.</p>

              <section class="information-history">
                <p class="information-history__paragraph ">Yet there are too many facts to support the existence of this man. Independent testimonials from all over the world describe similar, detailed experiences, and these people had no connection with each other before sharing their stories.</p>
                <p class="information-history__paragraph ">Could these isolated but similar testimonies reveal a hidden reality that some would prefer to keep in the shadows? Does not coincidence have its limits? You be the judge, but the facts seem to point to a disturbing truth, far removed from mere urban legend.</p>

                <h2 class="information-debunk__title">In the end, is this man real ?</h2>
                <p class="information-debunk__paragraph">No, <span class="bold">this man</span> is not real. Or at least, this story about a portrait drawn by a psychiatrist's patient is entirely false, invented by Andrea Natella for marketing purposes. Like many urban legends or "creepy-pastas", this hoax worked very well, with so many people believing the story that they went so far as to create theories to explain the phenomenon, making <span class="bold">his man </span>tfamous all over the world. </p>
                <p class="information-debunk__paragraph">So why are there so many accounts of <span class="bold">this man ? Why do so many people claim to have seen him in their dreams ? </span></p>
                <p class="information-debunk__paragraph">Here is a representative diagram of potential explanations for the appearance of <span class="bold">this man </span>in dreams.</p>
